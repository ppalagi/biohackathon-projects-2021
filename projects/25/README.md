# Project 25: Making training materials FAIR: developing a lesson and a tool to assess FAIRness of training materials

## Abstract

The ELIXIR FAIR Training Focus Group aims to implement FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) principles in training. The group comprises members from ELIXIR and international communities, ensuring that all activities and outcomes engage the wider community. The group developed 10 simple rules for making training materials FAIR (https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007854) which have been enthusiastically received by the international training community. These rules provide a good starting point for applying FAIR principles to training materials, but further guidance, tools and training are still needed on this topic.

The goal of the proposed project is to build on and consolidate efforts around making training materials FAIR that will take place in 2021 e.g. CINECA Hackathon (April), ISCB/ECCB WEB (July), GOBLET AGM (October) amongst others. We specifically aim to:

- Build from the workshop on developing a lesson on making training materials FAIR that will take place during the GOBLET AGM (Oct 2021), and continue to develop and finalise the lesson.
- Define the specifications for a tool that will provide guidance on how to assess FAIRness of training materials
